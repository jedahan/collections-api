# ⚠️ the museum api has changed a bunch, this needs a rewrite

# scrapi, a metropolitan museum collections api

[scrAPI.org](http://scrapi.org) is an api that grabs object information from the metropolitan museum's [collections](http://metmuseum.org/collection) website.

### Get a random object (`/random`)
Try `curl scrapi.org/random` in a terminal, or just click on [/random](random)
```bash
$ curl 'scrapi.org/random'
{
  "CRDID": 12351,
  "accessionNumber": "65.211.3",
  ...
}
```

### Object information (`/object/:id`)

Try `curl scrapi.org/object/123` in a terminal, or just click on [object/1234](object/123)
```bash
$ curl 'scrapi.org/object/123'
{
  "CRDID": 123,
  "accessionNumber": "64.291.2",
  ...
}
```

### Searching for object ids (`/search/:terms`)

You can now search for terms, and get back an array of hrefs to object pages
```bash
$ curl 'scrapi.org/search/mirror'
{
  "collection": {
    "items": [
      {
          "href": "http://scrapi.org/object/156225"
      },
      {
          "href": "http://scrapi.org/object/207785"
      },
      ...
      ]
    }

}
```
### additional Params in search:

&page=X - for additional pages

&gallerynos=X for only objects in that gallery

### Filtering with the `fields` parameter

If you want to filter *any* response, use the `fields` parameter, like so:

```bash
$ curl 'scrapi.org/object/123?fields=title,whoList/who/name'
{
  "whoList": {
    "who": {
      "name": "Richard Wittingham"
    }
  },
  "title": "Andiron"
}
```

The syntax to filter out fields is loosely based on XPath:

- `a,b,c` comma-separated list will select multiple fields
- `a/b/c` path will select a field from its parent
- `a(b,c)` sub-selection will select many fields from a parent
- `a/*/c` the star `*` wildcard will select all items in a field

I like the following fields for basic object information: `fields=title,primaryArtistNameOnly,primaryImageUrl,medium,whatList/what/name,whenList/when/name,whereList/where/name,whoList/who/name`

If you do anything interesting with the code, it would be nice to give attribution to the contributors, or even better, become one!

### Installation and Deployment

The API requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/), uses [redis](http://redis.io/) for caching, and is built on the [koa](http://koajs.com/) web framework.

If you already have nodejs installed:

    which yarn || npm install -g yarn
    yarn
    yarn start
    open 127.0.0.1:8080 || xdg-open 127.0.0.1:8080

If you don't want to have to setup node, yarn, and redis on your local machine, I published a docker image:

    which docker || { sudo apt-get install -y docker || cask install docker }
    docker pull jedahan/collections-api
    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name collections-api jedahan/collections-api
    open 127.0.0.1:8080 || xdg-open 127.0.0.1:8080
    curl localhost:8080/random

You can build the docker image yourself if you want:

    which docker || { sudo apt-get install -y docker || cask install docker }
    docker build -t jedahan/collections-api:latest .
    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name collections-api jedahan/collections-api
    open 127.0.0.1:8080 || xdg-open 127.0.0.1:8080
    curl localhost:8080/random
